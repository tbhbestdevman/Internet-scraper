The shared dependencies between the files we are generating for the web scraper are:

1. **Scrapy**: This is the main dependency for all the files as it is the framework being used for web scraping. All the files will import various modules from Scrapy.

2. **Item Class**: Defined in "web_scraper/web_scraper/items.py", this class will be used to define the data model for the scraped data. It will be imported and used in "web_scraper/web_scraper/spiders/scraper.py" and "web_scraper/web_scraper/pipelines.py".

3. **Scraper Spider**: Defined in "web_scraper/web_scraper/spiders/scraper.py", this is the main spider that will be used to scrape the data. It will be referenced in "web_scraper/scrapy.cfg".

4. **Pipelines**: Defined in "web_scraper/web_scraper/pipelines.py", these are used to process the scraped data. They will be referenced in "web_scraper/web_scraper/settings.py".

5. **Middlewares**: Defined in "web_scraper/web_scraper/middlewares.py", these are used to handle requests and responses. They will be referenced in "web_scraper/web_scraper/settings.py".

6. **Settings**: Defined in "web_scraper/web_scraper/settings.py", these are used to configure the behavior of the Scrapy spider. They will be referenced in "web_scraper/scrapy.cfg" and "web_scraper/web_scraper/spiders/scraper.py".

7. **JSON**: This is the format in which the scraped data will be stored. It will be used in "web_scraper/web_scraper/pipelines.py".

8. **DOM Elements**: The specific DOM elements to be scraped will be defined in "web_scraper/web_scraper/spiders/scraper.py". They are shared as they determine what data is extracted.

9. **Pagination and Dynamic Content Handling**: These features will be implemented in "web_scraper/web_scraper/spiders/scraper.py" and are shared as they affect how the spider navigates and scrapes the web pages.
